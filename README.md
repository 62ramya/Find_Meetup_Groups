# Find_Meetup_Groups

Here, I have identified various Python meetup groups from cities of India, USA, UK, HK, TW and Australia by following below steps and writting python codes for same.
Fetch information from meetup.com using the API they have provided
Move the data into a DataFrame and
Analyse it and join the right groups

Thanks,
